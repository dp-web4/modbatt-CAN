# modbatt-CAN

**ModBatt Configuration Utility - Windows CAN Interface Tool**

## Overview

The modbatt-CAN utility is a Windows application providing configuration, monitoring, and diagnostic capabilities for the ModBatt battery management system. It demonstrates how the hierarchical battery architecture can be configured and observed through a CAN bus interface.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Illustrative utility** for demonstration and development purposes

### Quick Facts

- **Platform**: Windows (C++ Builder)
- **Hardware**: Requires PEAK-System CAN interface (PCAN-USB, PCAN-PCIe, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and testing
- **License**: AGPL-3.0-or-later (software); Borland runtime appropriate to intended use

## Features

### üîß Configuration
- **Module Setup**: Register and configure battery modules
- **Cell Mapping**: Define cell-to-module associations
- **Calibration**: Voltage and temperature sensor calibration
- **Parameters**: Set operational thresholds and safety limits

### üìä Monitoring
- **Real-time Display**: Live voltage, temperature, and status for all cells
- **Pack Visualization**: Hierarchical view of pack ‚Üí module ‚Üí cell
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical data logging and graphing
- **Fault Detection**: Real-time error and warning display

### üîç Diagnostics
- **CAN Bus Monitor**: Raw message inspection and logging
- **Message Injection**: Send test commands for validation
- **Protocol Analysis**: Decode ModBatt CAN protocol messages
- **Hardware Testing**: Verify communication paths and component health

### üåê Web4 Integration (Conceptual)

This utility provides the foundation for future Web4 integration:
- **API-Bridge Interface**: Specification for blockchain LCT integration (see `docs/API_BRIDGE_INTERFACE.md`)
- **Provenance Tracking**: Framework for build manifest verification
- **Identity Binding**: Support for hardware serial ‚Üí LCT mapping

## Hardware Requirements

### CAN Interface

**Required**: Genuine PEAK-System CAN hardware

The application uses the PCAN-Basic API from PEAK-System Technik GmbH:
- **Supported Hardware**: PCAN-USB, PCAN-PCIe, PCAN-ISA, etc.
- **License**: DLL and headers freely redistributable (see `docs/PCAN_LICENSE_SUMMARY.md`)
- **Restriction**: Must be used only with genuine PEAK-System hardware
- **Download**: https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Basic.239.0.html

### ModBatt Hardware

- Pack Controller with CAN interface
- Battery modules with CAN communication
- Appropriate power supply and safety equipment

## Development

### Build Environment

**Platform**: Windows with Embarcadero C++ Builder (or compatible)

**Note**: This is an illustrative utility. The Borland/Embarcadero runtime licensing should be appropriate to your intended use. Migration to open-source development platforms (Qt, wxWidgets, etc.) is encouraged for production deployments.

### Getting Started

1. Open `modbatt.cbproj` in C++ Builder
2. Ensure PCAN-Basic API installed
3. Build and run
4. Connect PCAN hardware and ModBatt system
5. Configure CAN interface settings

See `Modbatt Configuration Tool/README.md` for comprehensive UI guide.

## API-Bridge Integration

The utility includes specifications for integrating with a Web4 API-Bridge service for blockchain functionality:

- **REST API Specification**: `docs/API_BRIDGE_INTERFACE.md`
- **LCT Management**: Entity creation, binding, pairing
- **Witnessing**: Presence and behavior attestation
- **Trust Tensors**: T3/V3 reputation tracking

**Status**: Interface defined; implementation depends on API-Bridge availability.
