# PATENT-LICENSE — Limited Software Grant (AGPL Scope)

Owner grants to any recipient of the software under AGPL-3.0-or-later a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license under Owner’s patents that are necessarily infringed **by the unmodified
reference implementation of this repository** to make, use, and distribute software **solely
as needed to exercise the AGPL rights**.

**Exclusions:** This grant does **not** extend to (a) manufacture, sale, or import of hardware;
(b) implementations that remove or circumvent required safety/provenance features;
(c) combinations primarily intended to avoid reciprocity obligations.

**Defensive Termination:** This license terminates automatically for any entity that asserts
a patent claim against Owner or users of this software alleging that the reference implementation
infringes a patent.

**Hardware Licensing:** A separate **royalty-free** hardware license is available to qualified
commercial implementers, contingent on auditability and compliance with safety/provenance requirements.
See `docs/ModBatt_Product_License.pdf`.
