# EBF Certification Overview (Draft)

The **Extendable Battery Framework (EBF)** certification ensures safety, provenance, and interoperability:

1) Device identity + provenance (LCT/DID or equivalent), with immutable build hash.
2) Telemetry integrity: voltage/current/temp/SOC/SOH + fault flags, schema-compliant.
3) Safety invariants enforced in firmware (OCP/OVP/OTP) and logged to provenance.
4) Field audit: manufacturing lot traceability and recall path.

Royalty-free hardware license is contingent on passing EBF certification.
