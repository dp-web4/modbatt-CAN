# Modbatt System Implementation - Next Steps

## Current State

- Three-tier transaction protocol defined: Binding, Pairing, Validation
- Semi-public key architecture established for zero-knowledge auth controller
- 7-level validation hierarchy with escalation mechanisms
- Access data and LCT information integrated throughout protocol

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Binding Transaction Implementation

#### 1.1 Binding API Implementation
**Device/Entity Requirements:**
- Implement `/api/binding/generate-keys` endpoint
- Accept partner access data as input
- Generate asymmetric key pair (semi-public/private)
- Store partner access data and private key securely
- Return semi-public key to auth controller

**Auth Controller Requirements:**
- Validate binding authority through external means
- Collect access data for both entities
- Call key generation API on each entity
- Distribute semi-public keys cross-wise
- Record binding in private blockchain

#### 1.2 Key Architecture
**Semi-Public Keys:**
- Generated per binding relationship
- Shared only with auth controller and bound partner
- Used for high-value validation events
- Never exposed publicly

**Access Data Storage:**
- Store partner's complete access data:
  - Endpoint (URL, CAN address, etc.)
  - Protocol type (CAN, HTTP, MQTT)
  - Device ID
  - Bound LCT information (if applicable)

#### 1.3 Binding Record Management
```json
{
  "binding_id": "uuid",
  "entity_a": {
    "access_data": {...},
    "semi_public_key": "base64_key",
    "bound_lct": {...}
  },
  "entity_b": {
    "access_data": {...},
    "semi_public_key": "base64_key",
    "bound_lct": {...}
  },
  "timestamp": "utc_timestamp",
  "authority": "controller_signature"
}
```

### Phase 2: Pairing Transaction Implementation

#### 2.1 Pairing Certificate Generation
**Auth Controller Tasks:**
- Generate 64-byte symmetric key for pairing
- Split into two 32-byte halves
- Generate exchange key for key half sharing
- Create clear metadata with:
  - Entity access data
  - Timing restrictions
  - Encryption policy (critical vs routine)
  - Context and restrictions

#### 2.2 Certificate Structure Implementation
**Three Encrypted Sections:**
1. **Entity A Section** (encrypted with A's semi-public key):
   - A's half of symmetric key
   - SHA256 hash of clear metadata
   - Exchange key

2. **Entity B Section** (encrypted with B's semi-public key):
   - B's half of symmetric key
   - SHA256 hash of clear metadata
   - Exchange key

3. **Handshake Validation Section** (encrypted with full pairing key):
   - Validation nonce
   - Auth controller callback endpoint
   - Completion instructions

#### 2.3 Key Exchange Protocol
**Entity-to-Entity Exchange:**
- Use exchange key to share key halves
- Combine halves to reconstruct pairing key
- Decrypt handshake validation section
- Send completion proof to auth controller

**Completion Validation:**
```json
{
  "pairing_id": "from_certificate",
  "validation_nonce": "from_handshake_section",
  "entity_signatures": {
    "entity_a": "binding_key_signature",
    "entity_b": "binding_key_signature"
  }
}
```

#### 2.4 Selective Encryption Implementation
**Three-Tier Encryption:**
1. **Binding Keys (Asymmetric)** - High-value events
   - Validation transactions
   - Certificate signing
   - Identity verification

2. **Pairing Key (Symmetric, 64 bytes)** - Medium-value events
   - Command and control
   - Configuration changes
   - Critical telemetry

3. **Exchange Key (Symmetric, lightweight)** - Low-value encrypted events
   - Routine telemetry
   - Status updates
   - Non-critical logs

### Phase 3: Validation Hierarchy Implementation

#### 3.1 Validation Event Processing
**Level 1: Announce**
- Implement public broadcast mechanism
- Sign with binding private key
- Include access data and bound LCT info

**Level 2: Witness**
- Request witness acknowledgment
- Collect witness signature
- Record witnessed event

**Level 3: Signed Handshake**
- Exchange signatures without pairing
- Generate ephemeral session key
- Limited duration or single-use

**Level 4: Paired Handshake**
- Use existing pairing key
- Challenge-response authentication
- Session re-establishment

**Level 5: Paired Command/Control**
- Encrypt with pairing key
- Sign with binding key
- Require acknowledgment

**Level 6: Pairing Validation**
- Involve auth controller
- Multi-party signatures
- Completion/revocation events

**Level 7: Binding Validation**
- Maximum security with LCT involvement
- Blockchain proof
- Permanent record

#### 3.2 Escalation Mechanism
```json
"escalation_request": {
  "target_level": 5,
  "reason": "anomaly_detected",
  "urgency": "immediate"
}
```
- Monitor for escalation requests
- Dynamically adjust security level
- Log escalation events

### Phase 4: CAN Bus Integration

#### 4.1 CAN Message Encryption
**Message Format with Encryption Levels:**
- Bit 17: General encryption flag
- Bits 18-19: Encryption level (00=none, 01=exchange, 10=pairing, 11=binding)
- Payload structure based on level

#### 4.2 Protocol-Specific Implementation
**Pack Controller â†” Battery Module:**
- Binding establishment at manufacturing
- Pairing for operational contexts
- Validation events for state changes

**Critical Operations (Pairing Key):**
- Charge/discharge commands
- Safety limits configuration
- Firmware updates

**Routine Monitoring (Exchange Key or Clear):**
- Voltage/current telemetry
- Temperature readings
- Status heartbeats

### Phase 5: Security and Testing

#### 5.1 Security Implementation
**Key Storage:**
- Secure flash regions for private keys
- Memory protection for runtime keys
- Key derivation using HKDF-SHA256

**Cryptographic Libraries:**
- AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
- RSA-2048 or ECC-P256 for asymmetric
- SHA-256 for hashing

#### 5.2 Testing Requirements
**Unit Tests:**
- Binding transaction flow
- Pairing certificate generation/validation
- All 7 validation levels
- Escalation mechanism

**Integration Tests:**
- Full binding-pairing-validation flow
- CAN bus encrypted communication
- Multi-device pairing scenarios

**Security Tests:**
- Attempt key extraction
- Replay attack prevention
- Man-in-the-middle resistance

## Success Criteria

## Risk Mitigation

- **Replay Attacks**: Nonces and sequence numbers in all protocols
- **Escalation Abuse**: Rate limiting and authentication for escalations
