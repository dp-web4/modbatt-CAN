## Enhanced Cryptographic Architecture

### **1. Trust-Adaptive Encryption Strength**

#### **Dynamic Encryption Levels Based on T3 Scores**
```
High Trust Entities (T3 > 0.8):
├── Reduced encryption overhead for frequent operations
├── Streamlined key exchange protocols
├── Extended session key lifetimes
└── Optimized for performance

Medium Trust Entities (T3 0.4-0.8):
├── Standard AES-256-GCM encryption
├── Regular key rotation schedules
├── Standard authentication requirements
└── Balanced security/performance

Low Trust Entities (T3 < 0.4):
├── Enhanced encryption with additional authentication
├── Frequent key rotation
├── Extended validation requirements
└── Security-prioritized operations
```

#### **Trust Score Integration**
```cpp
// Example: Encryption strength selection
EncryptionLevel SelectEncryptionLevel(T3Tensor entityT3) {
    if (entityT3.overall > 0.8 && entityT3.temperament > 0.7) {
        return OPTIMIZED_ENCRYPTION;  // High trust, reliable behavior
    } else if (entityT3.overall > 0.4) {
        return STANDARD_ENCRYPTION;   // Medium trust
    } else {
        return ENHANCED_ENCRYPTION;   // Low trust, extra validation
    }
}
```
