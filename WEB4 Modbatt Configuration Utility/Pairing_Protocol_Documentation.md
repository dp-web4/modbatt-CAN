# Modbatt WEB4 Trust Relationship Protocol

## Overview

The Modbatt system implements a **WEB4 trust-driven architecture** using Linked Context Tokens (LCTs) to establish cryptographic identity and trust relationships between battery management components. This goes beyond traditional pairing to create a **decentralized trust network** with energy flow tracking and value accountability.

## Protocol Architecture

### LCT Identity and Trust Layer

Each component in the system has a **permanently bound, non-transferable LCT** (Linked Context Token) that serves as its cryptographic root identity within the battery management context. LCTs provide:

- **Immutable Identity**: Permanently bound to specific hardware/software entity
- **Trust Relationships**: Malleable links to other LCTs forming trust webs
- **Cryptographic Material**: Device and Web4 key halves for secure operations
- **Value Tracking**: Foundation for ATP/ADP energy flow and accountability
- **Context Authority**: Defines entity's role and capabilities within the system

### WEB4 Trust Relationship Establishment

The trust relationship process involves three main phases:

#### 1. LCT Identity Creation
Each component establishes its immutable WEB4 identity:
- **LCT binding**: Permanent, non-transferable token bound to hardware/software entity
- **Cryptographic root**: Establishes verifiable identity on blockchain
- **Context definition**: Defines role within battery management ecosystem
- **Trust initialization**: Sets baseline trust metrics and capabilities

#### 2. Trust Web Formation
The API-Bridge creates cryptographic trust relationships between LCTs:
- **LCT relationship**: POST /api/v1/lct/create establishes malleable trust link
- **Device key halves**: 64-byte cryptographic material for secure CAN communication
- **LCT key halves**: 64-byte cryptographic material for Web4/blockchain operations
- **Trust tensor initialization**: Establishes baseline T3 (capability) and V3 (value) metrics

#### 3. Trust Network Activation
The Modbatt app orchestrates trust network initialization:
1. **Cryptographic distribution**: LCT and device key halves with security parameters
2. **Trust relationship validation**: Verification of cryptographic trust links
3. **ATP/ADP initialization**: Setup of energy flow tracking and value accountability
4. **Operational authorization**: Enable trusted operations within defined context

Components establish encrypted communication and begin trust-based energy operations.

## WEB4 Trust Properties

### Immutable Identity Assurance
- Each LCT is permanently and cryptographically bound to its physical entity
- Non-transferable tokens prevent identity theft or impersonation
- Component failure results in LCT being marked void/slashed, maintaining integrity

### Trust Web Integrity
- Malleable trust relationships can strengthen or weaken based on performance
- Trust tensors (T3/V3) provide quantifiable metrics for capability and value
- Network-wide reputation system emerges from validated performance history

### Energy Flow Accountability
- ATP/ADP cycles create complete audit trail of energy transfers
- Value creation must be certified by energy recipients
- Trust-based exchange rates incentivize reliable performance

### Cryptographic Isolation
- Device key halves enable secure CAN communication without blockchain exposure
- LCT key halves enable Web4 operations without exposing device communications
- Zero-knowledge proofs protect component privacy while maintaining accountability

## WEB4 Implementation Flow

1. **LCT Identity Phase**: Components establish immutable blockchain identities with bound LCTs
2. **Trust Web Creation**: API-Bridge generates malleable trust relationships and cryptographic material
3. **Trust Network Initialization**: App distributes keys and establishes trust tensor baselines
4. **Cryptographic Activation**: Components derive encryption keys and validate trust relationships
5. **ATP/ADP Initialization**: Energy flow tracking and value accountability systems activated
6. **Trust-Based Operations**: Encrypted communication with performance-based trust adjustment
7. **Emergent Optimization**: Self-improving system behavior based on proven trust and value

## System Architecture: Auth Controller Implementation

In the Modbatt system, the **authentication controller** is implemented as the **API-bridge interface to the blockchain**:

### Component Roles
- **Blockchain**: Serves as the trusted authority for pairing permissions and audit trails
- **API-Bridge Interface**: Handles cryptographic operations, key generation, and pairing package formatting
- **Modbatt Configuration Utility**: Acts as the delivery mechanism, fetching packages from blockchain and distributing to devices

### System Flow
```
Blockchain (Component Registry)
    ↓ (manages component registration)
API-Bridge Interface 
    ↓ (generates device key halves via LCT creation)
Modbatt Configuration Utility 
    ↓ (distributes keys + crypto parameters)
Pack Controller ← → Battery Module
    ↓ (combine keys and establish encryption)
Secure CAN Communication
```

### Implementation Benefits
1. **Centralized Authority**: Blockchain provides authoritative source for component registration
2. **Immutable Records**: All component relationships recorded on blockchain for audit trails
3. **Key Isolation**: API-bridge generates key halves but cannot derive final encryption keys
4. **Flexible Distribution**: App handles complete key package distribution and crypto setup

## Use Case: Pack Controller and Battery Module

In the Modbatt system:
- **Pack Controller**: Receives device key halves from API-Bridge via app distribution
- **Battery Module**: Receives device key halves from pack controller during key exchange
- **Modbatt Configuration Utility**: Manages blockchain registration and distributes complete key packages
- Both devices combine key halves using HKDF and establish AES-256-GCM encrypted communication

## Security Benefits

1. **Compromise Resistance**: Single component compromise doesn't expose full communication keys
2. **Forward Secrecy**: Pairing keys are independent of ongoing device communications
3. **Audit Trail**: All pairing events can be recorded without exposing key material
4. **Scalability**: Protocol supports multiple device pairs without key management complexity
