## Document Information

- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: August 2025
- **Status**: Architecture Documentation
- **Context**: WEB4 Trust-Driven Battery Management System

## WEB4 Foundation

The Modbatt system implements a **trust-driven, decentralized battery management architecture** using WEB4 principles, moving beyond traditional centralized control to establish cryptographic trust relationships and energy flow tracking.

### Core WEB4 Concepts in Modbatt

#### **Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)**
- **Cryptographic Root Identity**: Each component has a permanently bound, non-transferable LCT
- **Context-Specific**: LCTs operate within the battery management context
- **Trust Web Formation**: LCTs create malleable links between components
- **Immutable Binding**: If a component fails/dies, its LCT is marked void or slashed

#### **Alignment Transfer Protocol (ATP/ADP)**
- **Energy Flow Tracking**: ATP tokens represent available energy/operations
- **Value Creation Cycles**: Energy expenditure (ATP → ADP), value creation (ADP → ATP)
- **Auditable Trail**: All energy transfers recorded immutably on blockchain
- **Trust-Based Exchange**: ADP→ATP conversion rates based on verified performance

## Modbatt System Entities

```

#### **ADP (Discharged State) Transitions**
```
Energy Expenditure Events:
├── Battery discharge operations
├── System management overhead
├── Communication and monitoring activities
