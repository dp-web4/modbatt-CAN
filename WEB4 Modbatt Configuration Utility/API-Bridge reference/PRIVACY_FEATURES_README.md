# Privacy-Focused Component Registry Features

This document describes the new privacy-focused features implemented in the Web4 Component Registry API Bridge, designed to protect trade secrets while maintaining verification capabilities.

## Overview

The privacy-focused features enable manufacturers to register and manage components anonymously using cryptographic hashes, ensuring that sensitive commercial data remains off-chain while still providing verification and pairing capabilities.

## Key Privacy Features

### 1. Anonymous Component Registration

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/components/register-anonymous`

Registers a component using anonymous hashes instead of exposing real component IDs and manufacturer data.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "creator": "alice",
  "real_component_id": "BM-2024-001",
  "manufacturer_id": "Tesla Motors",
  "component_type": "LITHIUM_ION_BATTERY",
  "context": "privacy_demo_registration"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "component_hash": "hash_abc123...",
  "manufacturer_hash": "hash_def456...",
  "category_hash": "hash_ghi789...",
  "status": "active",
  "trust_anchor": "cryptographic_trust_anchor",
  "txhash": "tx_hash_123...",
  "timestamp": 1703123456
}
```

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Real component ID is never stored on-chain
- Manufacturer identity is cryptographically hashed
- Component specifications remain off-chain
- Only anonymous hashes are visible on the blockchain

### 2. Hash-Based Pairing Verification

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/components/verify-pairing-hashes`

Verifies if two components can pair using only their cryptographic hashes.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "verifier": "charlie",
  "component_hash_a": "hash_abc123...",
  "component_hash_b": "hash_def456...",
  "context": "pairing_verification"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "can_pair": true,
  "reason": "pairing allowed: components are compatible",
  "trust_score": "0.85",
  "txhash": "tx_hash_456...",
  "timestamp": 1703123456
}
```

**Privacy Benefits:**
- No need to expose real component identities for pairing verification
- Verification works entirely with anonymous hashes
- Trust scores can be calculated without revealing component details

### 3. Anonymous Pairing Authorization

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/components/authorization-anonymous`

Creates pairing authorization between components using only their hashes.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "creator": "alice",
  "component_hash_a": "hash_abc123...",
  "component_hash_b": "hash_def456...",
  "rule_hash": "hash_rules_789...",
  "trust_score_requirement": "0.7",
  "authorization_level": "basic"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "auth_id": "auth_xyz789...",
  "status": "active",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "txhash": "tx_hash_789...",
  "timestamp": 1703123456
}
```

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Authorization rules are hashed and anonymous
- No exposure of real component relationships
- Expiration and trust requirements are managed privately

### 4. Anonymous Revocation Events

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/components/revocation-anonymous`

Creates revocation events for components using only their hashes.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "creator": "david",
  "target_hash": "hash_abc123...",
  "revocation_type": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "urgency_level": "HIGH",
  "reason_category": "SAFETY_CONCERN",
  "context": "regulatory_action"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "revocation_id": "revoke_xyz789...",
  "status": "revoked",
  "effective_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "txhash": "tx_hash_789...",
  "timestamp": 1703123456
}
```

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Revocation events protect component anonymity
- Regulatory actions can be recorded without exposing identities
- Urgency and reason categories provide context without details

### 5. Anonymous Component Metadata

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/components/metadata-anonymous/{component_hash}`

Retrieves only non-sensitive metadata for a component hash.

**Request:**
```
GET /api/v1/components/metadata-anonymous/hash_abc123...?requester=charlie
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "component_hash": "hash_abc123...",
  "type": "MODULE",
  "status": "active",
  "trust_anchor": "cryptographic_trust_anchor",
  "last_verified": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "txhash": "tx_hash_789...",
  "timestamp": 1703123456
}
```

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Only generic component type is revealed (e.g., "MODULE" instead of "LITHIUM_ION_BATTERY")
- No commercial specifications are exposed
- Trust anchor and verification status are maintained
- Last verification timestamp provides audit trail

## Architecture Benefits
